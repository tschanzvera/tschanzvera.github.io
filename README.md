# PORTFOLIO VERA TSCHANZ

## DESCRIPTION

This is my portfolio repository that I had to do as a project in my MITxPRO course which I am currently enrolled. I hope to add and update it over time. There is also an HTML file with a little move ball project that I had to do a couple weeks ago. 

You can view my profile page here https://tschanzvera.github.io/
